# STDISCM_ParallelProgramming

A parallel-based program that performs bulk image enhancement through the use of threads and locks.

2. Create an empty output folder.
3. Run the entire notebook 'final_notebook.ipynb'.
4. Input all needed arguments correctly.
5. Wait for the program to finish running.
6. Check for the output which is a 'result.txt' and the enhanced images.
